# NLP-GPT-Resume-Generation
This repository contains the codes to train an NLP model using GPT architecture from scratch to generate resumes.

## Processing the data
First, download the data via the command:
```
wget https://github.com/florex/resume_corpus/raw/master/resumes_corpus.zip
```
Unzip the file to get the `resume_corpus` folder containing the resume data. Next, run the script
```
python clean_resume_data.py
```
to extract the word tokens and do some simple cleaning of the data. This script will generate the `resume_data.pkl` file required for training the model. Note: Remember to change or update the location of the `resume_corpus` folder in line 10 of the `clean_resume_data.py` code.

## Training the Model
To train the model, run the script
```
python train_resume_gpt.py
```
Once the model has been trained, run the script
```
python infer_resume_gpt.py
```
to perform inference. Note: Remember to change or update the location of the `resume_data.pkl` in lines 93 to 95 of the `train_resume_gpt.py` script and lines 28 to 30 of the `infer_resume_gpt.py` script for the training and inference to run smoothly.

## Sample Resume Text Generation
Some sample resumes generated by the model at the 5,000 iteration (capped at 250 words).
